This report details the technical framework and principal findings of the MDS Afforestation Monitoring project. The project's central goal was to create and validate a data-driven system for monitoring the progress of afforestation initiatives across Canada.

Afforestation plays a vital role in carbon capture, biodiversity enhancement, and climate resilience, while also benefiting communities by providing green spaces and reducing wildfire and flood risks. To advance these goals, the Canadian government launched the 2 Billion Trees program, aiming to plant two billion trees nationwide over 10 years. However, monitoring the success of such large-scale efforts is challenging, especially in the early stages when young trees are hard to detect with traditional remote sensing due to their sparse canopies. This makes tracking survival rates across Canadaâ€™s diverse and remote planting sites a complex task for Natural Resources Canada. In this research study, we want to discover whether satellite-derived vegetation indices and site-lvel data will be useful for training predictive models.

Our methodology integrates satellite-derived vegetation indices with site-level data to train predictive models. This curated dataset was used to train and evaluate a suite of machine learning models and a deep learning model aimed at classifying the survival outcomes of newly planted forests. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the entire data science pipeline, from data acquisition and preprocessing to feature engineering and model evaluation.

A comparative analysis of classical machine learning algorithms and a deep learning architecture identified the Random Forest model as the most effective. It achieved an F1-score of approximately 0.52. While this performance does not align with expectations, it establishes a crucial baseline for further scientific research.

The report concludes with actionable recommendations for future work, including the integration of higher-resolution data and more advanced model architectures.
