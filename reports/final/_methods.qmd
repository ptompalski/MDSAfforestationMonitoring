### Phase 1: Static Models
- **Preprocessing:** Drop IDs/dates, scale spectral indices & density, one-hot encode species type.
- **Models & Hyperparameters:**  
  - Logistic Regression: C (regularization strength), penalty=l2  
  - Random Forest: n_estimators, max_depth  
  - XGBoost: learning_rate (eta), max_depth, reg_alpha, reg_lambda  
- **Tuning & Validation:** Randomized search (50–300 iterations) with grouped 5-fold CV (by site ID), optimizing F1 score.

### Phase 2: Temporal Models
- **Sequence Preparation:**  
  - Aggregate per-site yearly spectral indices into variable-length sequences.  
  - Engineer time features: log-transformed Δt, seasonality via sine/cosine of Day-of-Year.
- **Models & Hyperparameters:**  
  - GRU: hidden_size=32, num_layers=1, dropout=0.2, lr=1e-3, optimizer=Adam  
  - LSTM: same architecture and training settings.
- **Training & Evaluation:**  
  - Trained for 25 epochs with early stopping (patience=5).  
  - Batch size=64, padded sequences, tracked sequence lengths.  

### Metrics & Ethics
- **Primary Metrics:** Precision, Recall, F1 (primary).  
- **Cross-Validation:** GroupKFold to prevent spatial leakage.  
- **Stakeholder Impact:** Emphasize recall to minimize false negatives (missed high-risk sites).
