## Introduction

Afforestation plays a vital role in combating climate change and protecting biodiversity. Trees capture and store carbon from the atmosphere, improve air and water quality, provide shelter and shade that reduce urban heat, and help cool our cities. More importantly, they serve as sources of food, nutrients, and habitats for countless living organisms[@canada2023_2bt_commitment].

Recognizing the essential benefits of trees, the Canadian federal government launched the **2 Billion Trees** program to provide financial support to provinces, territories, non-profit organizations, businesses, and Indigenous governments and organizations. The goal is to plant two billion trees across hundreds of sites nationwide over a 10-year period, by 2031 [@nrcan2021].

With this large-scale initiative underway, it becomes crucial to monitor the survival rates of the trees being planted â€” a task that poses significant logistical challenges. Remote sensing presents a promising solution by enabling large-scale environmental monitoring through satellite imagery. However, detecting small or newly planted trees from above remains difficult due to their limited canopy coverage and weak spectral signals [@ubc2025remotesensing].

In this study, we aim to investigate two main research questions:

- Can remote sensing data help reduce the number of field sites that must be physically visited?  
- Which modelling approach is most effective, and how long after planting is needed before accurate survival predictions can be made?
