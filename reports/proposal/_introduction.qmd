To advance these goals, the Canadian government launched the **2 Billion Trees** program, aiming to plant two billion trees nationwide by 2031 with support for provinces and territories [@nrcan2021].

Monitoring survival at scale is a major challenge. While remote sensing enables broad environmental monitoring, detecting small or newly planted trees remains difficult due to limited canopy coverage and weak spectral signals [@ubc2025remotesensing].

This study aim to address two key questions:
- Can remote sensing reduce the need for physical site visits?
- Which modelling approach is most effective, and how soon after planting can survival be reliably predicted?
