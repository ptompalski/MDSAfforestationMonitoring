The dataset used in this study includes field-measured survival rates of afforested sites collected by Forest Ontario [@ubc2025remotesensing], as well as satellite data products from the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) project [@hls].

### Out-of-range Values
During EDA, we noticed out-of-range values in the vegetation indices and survival rates. With the exception of TCB, TCW and TCG, the vegetation indices should range between -1 to 1 [@NDVI; @EVI2; @NDWI]. Survival rates should not exceed 100%. Out-of-range records will be removed from the dataset.


### Previous Land Use and Species Composition

Class imbalance was observed in `SpcsCmp`. With over 300 categories in `SpcsCmp`, it would not be practical to use it as a predictor for our model.  

Similarly, severe class imbalance was observed in `prevUse`, as such, it will also be excluded from our model. 

### Species Type
From `SpcsCmp`, we are able to impute the missing values in `Type`. Sites are classified as "Conifer" ("Deciduous") if $\ge 80 \%$ of the species are "Softwood" ("Hardwood"); otherwise, it would be classified as "Mixed" [@mixed]. 

As shown in @fig-diff_srvvR_vi, survival rates and spectral signals vary by species type, suggesting 'Type' could be a viable feature for our model. 

![Plot showing mean survival rate and vegetation index signals for different species types across Years 1, 2 and 5. There is a significant difference in the relationship between survival rate and spectral signals for different species types. Conifers show a weaker signal response to changes in survival rate. Deciduous shows the strongest response during the first two years. Mixed type shows a linear relationship between survival rate and spectral signal.](../../img/age_srvvR_vi.png){#fig-diff_srvvR_vi width=100%}


### Trends and Seasonality
From @fig-vi_seasonality, we observed clear seasonality in the spectral indices, where spectral signals peaked during the summer and dropped during winter. This would need to be accounted for during model development.

@fig-age_vi reveals a positive relationship between vegetation indices and tree age. Minimal changes in spectral signals are observed between ages 1 to 4, indicating potential difficulties in predicting the survival rates for younger trees.

### Collinearity {#sec-collnearity}
As shown in @fig-correlation, there is strong collinearity between the vegetation indices, except for TCB. 
The strongest correlation between survival rate and vegetation indices was observed in Year 7.
