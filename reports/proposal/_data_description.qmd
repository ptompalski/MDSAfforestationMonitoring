## Data Description

The dataset used in this study includes field-measured survival rates of afforested sites collected by Forest Ontario, as well as satellite data products from the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) project.

### Spectral Indicies
|Index|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|NDVI | Normalized Difference Vegetation Index|
|SAVI |Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index|
|MSAVI |Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index|
|EVI |Enhanced Vegetation Index|
|EVI2|Two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index|

|NBR |Normalized Burn Ratio|
|TCB |Tasseled Cap Brightness|
|TCG |Tasseled Cap Greenness|
|TCW |Tasseled Cap Wetness|


### Out-of-range Values
During EDA, we noticed that there are out-of-range values in the vegetation indicies and survival rates. With the exception of TCB, TCW and TCG, the vegetation indicies should range between -1 to 1[@NDVI; @SAVI; @MSAVI; @EVI;  @EVI2; @NDWI; @NBR]. The survival rates should not exceed 100. We will be removing these out-of-range records from the dataset.


### Previous Land Use and Species Composition
Class imbalance was observed in 'SpcsCmp' column. Given that there are over 300 categories in 'SpcsCmp', it would not be practical for us to use this column as a predictor for our model.  

Severe class imbalance are also observed in the 'prevUse' column, as such, we would also not be using 'prevUse' as a predictor for our model.

### Species Type
From 'SpcsCmp', we are able to impute the species type. Sites are classified as Conifer(Deciduous) if the proportion of softwood(hardwood) species >= 80%, else, they would be classified as mixed. 

@fig-diff_srvvR_vi shows that survival rates and spectral indices differs by species type, suggesting that 'Type' would be a viable feature to use as predictor for our model.

There is significant difference in the relationship between survival rate and VI signals for different species type. Conifers has a smaller signal response to change in survival rate. Deciduous shows the strongest response in the first two years. Mixed type shows a linear relationship between survival rate the spectral signal.](../../img/age_srvvR_vi.png){#fig-diff_srvvR_vi width=70%}


### Trends and Seasonality
Clear seasonality was observed in the spectral indices, where the signals peaked during the summer and dropped during winter months (@fig-vi_seasonality). This would be something that we need to address in our model.

@fig-age_vi also shows a positive relationship between vegetation indicies and tree age. Minimal change in vegetation indicies was observed between age 1 to age 4. Indicating potential difficulties in survival rate prediction for earlier years.

### Collinearity
From @fig-correlation, we observed strong collinearity between vegetation indices except for TCB. 
The strongest correlation between survival rate and vegetation indicies is observed in Year 7.
