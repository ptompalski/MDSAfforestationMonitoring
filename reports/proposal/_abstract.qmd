## Abstract

Monitoring afforestation progress across hundreds of sites presents a significant challenge. This project investigates the use of site-level data combined with satellite-derived spectral vegetation indices, within the context of Canada’s 2 Billion Trees program, to develop machine learning models that predict tree survival rates over a seven-year period following planting. We plan to train a suite of models, beginning with logistic regression as a baseline, and extending to more advanced techniques such as random forests, gradient boosting machines, and deep learning architectures—including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks—to account for temporal dependencies. Our research focuses on assessing the predictive value of site characteristics and spectral indices, and identifying the most effective modeling approaches. The outcomes are expected to support scalable, cost-effective strategies for monitoring large-scale reforestation efforts.
