Monitoring afforestation progress across hundreds of sites is a significant challenge. This project explores using site-level data and satellite-derived vegetation indices from Canadaâ€™s 2 Billion Trees program to build machine learning models that predict tree survival over seven years. We will train models ranging from logistic regression to more advanced techniques like random forests, gradient boosting, and deep learning (RNNs, LSTMs) to capture temporal patterns. The goal is to evaluate predictive features and modeling strategies that enable scalable, cost-effective monitoring of afforestation efforts.
