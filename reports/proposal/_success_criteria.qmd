The success of this project will be evaluated based on the relevance of selected predictors and the performance of key evaluation metrics (see @tbl-eval-metrics). A minimum target of **60% accuracy** has been set for correct predictions, which will serve as the **primary metric** for communicating results to non-technical audiences. However, due to class imbalance, metrics such as **log loss**, **F1 score**, and **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)/Precision-recall curve (PR) curves** will provide essential insights for technical stakeholders.

| **Metric**       | **Audience**                    |
|------------------|---------------------------------|
| Accuracy         | General (e.g., government officials) |
| Log Loss         | Technical                       |
| F1 Score         | Technical                       |
| ROC Curve (AUC)  | Technical                       |
| PR Curve (AUC)   | Technical                       |
