### Logistic Regression
As the simplest model, logistic regresion will serve as a baseline to contrast performance against other models.
Logistic regression may also aid in providing insight as to the most important indices via easily interpretable predictor coefficients.

### Aggregated Models: Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
Studies by @bergmuller2022predicting suggest that aggregated tree models may effectively utitlize vegetation indices to
predict tree mortality. Given this, we find it reasonable to test their performance in our analysis.
Random Forests and GBMs complement each other well, as the former produces an aggregation of 'overfit' trees which work in tandem
to produce more accurate responses, whereas the ladder produces a sequence of 'underfit' trees
which continuously correct on mistakes made by the previous iteration [@scikit-learn].

### Sequential Deep Learning Models: LSTMs, GRUs, etc.
If time permits, we may consider implementing sequential RNN-based deep learning models such as LSTMs and/or GRUs.
These models have the benefit of capturing nonâ€‘linear structure and can more effectively exploit changes in vegetation index response
across time [@paszke2019pytorch].
