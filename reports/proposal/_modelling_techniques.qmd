### Logistic Regression
Logistic regression will serve as a baseline to contrast performance against other, more complex models.
It may also provide insight into feature importance through interpretable coefficients.

### Aggregated Models: Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
Studies by @bergmuller2022predicting suggest that aggregated tree models may effectively utitlize vegetation indices to
predict tree mortality. Random Forests and GBMs complement each other well, as the former produces many 'overfit' trees in tandem
to produce more accurate responses, whereas the ladder iteratively produces 'underfit' trees
which correct on mistakes made by the previous [@scikit-learn].

### Sequential Deep Learning Models: LSTMs, GRUs, etc.
If time permits, we may consider implementing sequential RNN-based deep learning models such as LSTMs and/or GRUs.
These models have the benefit of capturing nonâ€‘linear structure and may exploit changes in vegetation indices
across time [@paszke2019pytorch].
