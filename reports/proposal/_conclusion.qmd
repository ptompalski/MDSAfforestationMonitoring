In this capstone, we demonstrated how remote‑sensing and site data can be combined in an end‑to‑end pipeline to predict afforestation survival rates. 

### Limitations
Our pipeline effectively combines remote‑sensing and field data to predict afforestation survival, but it has some limitations: gaps in yearly survival records can bias training; multicollinearity among spectral indices may mask true effects; class imbalance from few early losses can inflate accuracy; weak signals from very young trees challenge early detection; and seasonal misalignments can degrade performance. Despite this, our framework is scalable, and future work will focus on imputing missing data, selecting features to reduce collinearity, and developing temporal models that fully leverage multi‑date imagery.
