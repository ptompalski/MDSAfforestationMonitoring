This project addresses the challenge of monitoring tree survival across hundreds of afforestation sites in Canadaâ€™s 2 Billion Trees program. By leveraging site-level data and satellite-derived spectral indices, we evaluate machine learning and deep learning models to predict survival over time. Our approach spans from interpretable models like logistic regression to advanced methods such as random forests, gradient boosting, and recurrent neural networks. Identifying key predictors is essential for building effective, scalable tools to support national afforestation efforts.
