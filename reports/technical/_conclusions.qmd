The core question driving this project was: **Can we accurately predict seven‐year canopy survival for newly planted forest sites using only early‐stage remote sensing and stand‐level data?**  Conventional field surveys are too slow and costly to cover Canada’s vast afforestation programs, so an automated, data‐driven tool can accelerate decision‐making and resource allocation.

Our reproducible pipeline—spanning raw R Data Series ingestion, feature preprocessing, spectral sequence extraction, and three model pipelines (logistic regression, XGBoost, GRU)—demonstrates that machine‐learning can indeed flag high‐risk sites early.  The XGBoost model (F1 = 0.72, AUC = 0.65) provides a practical balance of precision (75 %) and recall (60 %), allowing silviculture teams to prioritize field visits and remediation for those sites most likely to suffer seedling mortality.  The GRU model achieves comparable ranking ability (AUC ≈ 0.65), highlighting the value of capturing temporal trends, though at higher computational cost.

**Limitations**  
1. **Label Proxy**: Using ≥ 70 % canopy retention at year 7 as a binary label simplifies a complex reality. Understory regeneration or partial survival can be missed by this threshold.  
2. **Geographic & Survey Bias**: Training data come from plots where Year 7 surveys were conducted, often in accessible or pilot‐project zones. Remote or under‐surveyed regions may yield less reliable predictions.  
3. **Resource Requirements**: Full reprocessing (raw raster → Parquet) takes significant CPU hours, and GRU training requires GPUs. Partners with limited computational capacity may struggle to retrain models.  
4. **Feature Scope**: We used only spectral indices and basic stand attributes. Important predictors (soil texture, moisture regimes, LiDAR canopy height) were not available in the RDS. Incorporating them could boost performance but demands new data‐integration efforts.

**Recommendations for the Partner**  
1. **Deploy XGBoost as the Default Classifier**  
   - Given its strong F1 score and moderate resource requirements (CPU‐only), XGBoost is the most practical choice for regular risk scoring.  
   - Operationalize it by running `make train_models` each time a new satellite season’s data arrive.  
2. **Expand Ground‐Truth Data Collection**  
   - Encourage Year 7 surveys in underrepresented ecozones (e.g., northern or coastal regions) to reduce spatial bias.  
   - If possible, record additional ecological metrics (e.g., sapling basal area) to refine survival labels beyond the 70 % canopy threshold.  
3. **Monitor Model Drift & Retrain Regularly**  
   - As climate and planting practices evolve, periodically validate model performance (e.g., every two years).  
   - Automate a pipeline (e.g., via GitHub Actions or a nightly cron job) that reprocesses incoming RDS composites and retrains the classifier with updated labels.  
4. **Assess Sequence‐Aware Methods When GPUs Are Available**  
   - The GRU architecture shows promise, especially if partners can provision GPUs.  
   - Over time, consider using bidirectional RNNs or attention‐based models to further capture subtle phenological signals in spectral data.  
5. **Incorporate Additional Predictors**  
   - Investigate integrating soil moisture indices (e.g., from SMAP), topographic data (e.g., slope, aspect), or LiDAR‐derived canopy height metrics.  
   - Collaborate with data providers or research teams to secure these additional layers, which could raise AUC beyond 0.70.
  
In conclusion, our data product directly addresses the partner’s need for a scalable, interpretable, and reproducible tool to estimate afforestation success. While there are inherent limitations—most notably data availability and computational demands—the current workflow provides a strong foundation. By following the recommendations above, the partner can iteratively improve accuracy, reduce bias, and ultimately ensure that afforestation investments yield the intended ecological and economic benefits.
