### Limitations

Despite exploring both classical modeling and RNN modeling approaches,
all our models failed to deliver satisfactory results for predicting
tree survival rates. Here are the key limitations of our modeling
approaches:

1.  **Data Imbalance**

    Our data distribution was highly imbalanced, with the target values
    skewed heavily towards high survival rates. We believe this is the leading cause for the biased predictions
    across all of our models. 

2.  **Loss of Temporal Information in Classical Models**

    Our classical models fail to capture complex temporal structures in the
    satellite data.  By averaging the satellite data over time, we were losing a lot of
    vital information, including seasonal variations and short-term
    vegetation responses.

3.  **Lack of Spatial Information in RNN Models**

    Our RNN model lacks the ability to model spatial relationships between
    pixels. Each pixel is processed independently, ignoring spatial
    context within the same site. Neighboring pixels often share similar
    micro-climate and environmental conditions, without spatial data, 
    our model may overlook key spatial dependencies that influence vegetation response.

4.  **Misleading Target Labels**

    While our models were predicting at pixel level, survival records
    were recorded at site level and assigned uniformly to each pixel
    within a site. As a result, ‘healthy’ pixels and ‘unhealthy’ pixels are assigned
    identical targets labels, potentially misleading the model during
    training.

### Recommendations

1.  **Using Higher Resolution Satellite and Survey Data**

    Using higher-resolution satellite and field-survey data may help capture finer details and
    spatial variations between pixels of the a site,
    improving model performance. 

2.  **Obtaining Annual Survival Records**

    Acquiring additional training data with complete annual
    survival rate records would substantially enhance the dataset’s
    temporal resolution and modeling potential.

3.  **Modeling at Site Level**

    Since survival records are measured at site level, we recommend that 
    future models should aggregate satellite information across all pixels 
    within a site, making predictions per site rather than per pixel.

4.  **Incorporating Spatial Data**

    We suggest incorporating spatial data such as GPS coordinates to the
    current dataset, allowing the model to capture spatial
    correlations across sites and pixels.

5.  **CNN-LSTM model**

    Alternatively, we suggest using raw satellite imagery instead of
    pre-extracted spectral indices. Using satellite image directly allow us 
    to utilize convolutional architectures to learn spatial patterns, 
    potentially improving model performance.

    We propose exploring a CNN-LSTM architecture as a next step. In this
    hybrid approach, the satellite image for each site will first passed through a
    CNN to extract spatial features. The CNN outputs at each time step is then 
    fed into an LSTM or GRU to capture temporal patterns.
    The final hidden state can be passed through fully connected layers
    to predict the survival rate for the entire site. This architecture
    naturally accommodates both spatial and temporal dependencies,
    addressing key shortcomings of our current models.
