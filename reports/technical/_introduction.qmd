Monitoring the success of large-scale afforestation initiatives is a critical yet complex challenge especially for early growth stages. Young trees often produce weak spectral signals due to sparse canopies, making them difficult to detect using traditional remote sensing methods. As part of Canada’s 2 Billion Trees program—which aims to plant two billion trees across Canadian provinces by 2031—Natural Resources Canada must track survival rates across hundreds of ecologically diverse and often remote planting sites.

This problem is crucial because the ecological and climate benefits of afforestation—such as carbon reduction, and biodiversity restoration can only be realized if newly planted trees survive and grow. 

In this study, we aim to investigate two main research questions:

- Can satellite-derived vegetation indices and site-level data be used to accurately predict tree survival over time in large-scale afforestation programs? 
- Which modelling approach is most effective, and how long after planting is needed before accurate survival predictions can be made?

To address these qestions, this study leverages satellite-derived vegetation indices and site-level data to train machine learning models. By evaluating multiple modelling approaches—including logistic regression, random forests, and deep learning architectures—we aim to determine which techniques provide the most accurate predictions of tree survival rate to support the mission of supporting sustainable forest management and addressing climate change.
