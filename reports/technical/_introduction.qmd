Afforestation is essential for capturing carbon, enhancing biodiversity, and improving forest resilience to climate change. It also supports human well-being by providing green spaces for nature-based activities, which can improve mental health and reduce the risks of wildfires and floods in communities. Recognizing its importance, the Canadian government launched the 2 Billion Trees program to provide financial support for organizations to plant trees over ten years across Canadian provinces. However, monitoring the success of large-scale afforestation initiatives remains a critical and complex challenge, particularly during the early stages of growth. Young trees often produce weak spectral signals due to their sparse canopies, making them difficult to detect using traditional remote sensing methods [@ubc2025remotesensing]. As part of the 2 Billion Trees program—which aims to plant two billion trees across Canada by 2031—Natural Resources Canada must track survival rates across hundreds of ecologically diverse and often remote planting sites [@nrcan2021].

In this study, we aim to investigate two main research questions:

- Can satellite-derived vegetation indices and site-level data be used to accurately predict tree survival over time in large-scale afforestation programs? 
- Which modelling approach is most effective, and how long after planting is needed before accurate survival predictions can be made?

To address these questions, this study leverages satellite-derived vegetation indices and site-level data to train machine learning models. By evaluating multiple modelling approaches—including logistic regression, random forests, and deep learning models, namely recurrent neural network architectures—we aim to determine which techniques provide the most accurate predictions of tree survival rates to support the mission of sustainable forest management and addressing climate change.
