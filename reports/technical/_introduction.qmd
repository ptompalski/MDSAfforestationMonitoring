Afforestation is essential for capturing carbon, enhancing biodiversity, and improving forest resilience to climate change. It also supports human well-being by providing green spaces for nature-based activities, which can improve mental health and reduce the risks of wildfires and floods in communities. Recognizing its importance, the Canadian government launched the 2 Billion Trees program to provide financial support for organizations to plant trees over ten years across Canadian provinces. However, monitoring the success of large-scale afforestation initiatives remains a critical and complex challenge, particularly during the early stages of growth. Young trees often produce weak spectral signals due to their sparse canopies, making them difficult to detect using traditional remote sensing methods [@ubc2025remotesensing]. As part of the 2 Billion Trees program—which aims to plant two billion trees across Canada by 2031—Natural Resources Canada must track survival rates across hundreds of ecologically diverse and often remote planting sites [@nrcan2021].
