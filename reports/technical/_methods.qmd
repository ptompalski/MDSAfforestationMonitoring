We transform raw afforestation data into training-ready formats and apply two model categories.

### Data Preprocessing
- **Static pipeline:** Drops identifier/date columns, scales 11 spectral indices and density, and one-hot encodes species type into a fixed-length feature vector for each site.
- **Sequence pipeline:** Loads per-site time-series Parquet files, pads sequences to uniform length, applies masking, and adds engineered time features for temporal models.

### Traditional Models
- **Logistic Regression:** Fits a weighted linear model on static features to separate low- vs. high-survival sites.
  - **Hyperparameters:** regularization strength (`C`)
- **Random Forest:** Builds an ensemble of decision trees on static features, aggregating votes to improve robustness against noise.
  - **Hyperparameters:** number of trees (`n_estimators`), maximum tree depth (`max_depth`)
- **XGBoost:** Sequentially trains gradient-boosted trees with monotonicity constraints (on Age) to enhance predictive accuracy on survival.
  - **Hyperparameters:** tree depth (`max_depth`), learning rate (`learning_rate`), number of trees (`n_estimators`), regularization (`reg_alpha`, `reg_lambda`)

### Time-Series Models
- **GRU:** Uses gated recurrent units to capture temporal dependencies in annual spectral sequences before combining with static features for classification.
  - **Hyperparameters:** hidden size (`hidden_size`), dropout rate (`dropout`), learning rate (`lr`)
- **LSTM:** Employs long short-term memory cells with input, forget, and output gates to retain information across multiple years of spectral data.
  - **Hyperparameters:** hidden size (`hidden_size`), dropout rate (`dropout`), learning rate (`lr`)

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Precision & Recall:** Measure false positive vs. false negative trade-offs on held-out test data.
- **F1 Score:** Harmonizes precision and recall, used for cross-validation model selection.
- **AUC:** Evaluates overall ranking performance across threshold choices.
