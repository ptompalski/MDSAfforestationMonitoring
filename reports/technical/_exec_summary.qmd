This report presents the key technical approaches and findings from the MDS Afforestation Monitoring project. The primary objective was to develop and implement data-driven methodologies for monitoring afforestation efforts across diverse regions in Canada. By integrating satellite-derived vegetation indices with site-level data, the team trained machine learning and deep learning models to improve the detection and quantification of newly planted forests.

The report details the data science techniques applied throughout the data cleaning, processing, and analysis and modeling stages, and presents their effectiveness in assessing sites with both low and high survival rates. The report concludes with recommendations for future improvements and discusses potential applications of the developed system in broader environmental monitoring efforts.
