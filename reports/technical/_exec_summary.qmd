This report details the technical framework and principal findings of the MDS Afforestation Monitoring project. The project's central goal was to create and validate a data-driven system for monitoring the progress of afforestation initiatives across Canada.

Our methodology integrates satellite-derived vegetation indices with site-level data to train predictive models. This curated dataset was used to train and evaluate a suite of machine learning models and a deep learning model aimed at classifying the survival outcomes of newly planted forests. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the entire data science pipeline, from data acquisition and preprocessing to feature engineering and model evaluation.

A comparative analysis of classical machine learning algorithms and a deep learning architecture identified the Random Forest model as the most effective. It achieved an F1-score of approximately 0.52. While this performance does not aligns with expectations, it establishes a crucial baseline for further scientific research.

The report concludes with actionable recommendations for future work, including the integration of higher-resolution data and more advanced model architectures.
